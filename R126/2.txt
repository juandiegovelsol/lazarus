**Database Schema Design and Documentation**

### Hotels Table

*   **Purpose:** The Hotels table stores information about the hotels available in the system.
*   **Key Fields:**
    *   `id` (primary key, integer, NOT NULL, UNIQUE): A unique identifier for each hotel.
    *   `name` (varchar(255), NOT NULL): The name of the hotel.
    *   `address` (varchar(255), NOT NULL): The address of the hotel.
*   **Relationships:** A hotel can have multiple rooms (one-to-many), so the `id` field in the Hotels table is referenced by the `hotelId` field in the Rooms table.

### Rooms Table

*   **Purpose:** The Rooms table stores information about the rooms available in each hotel.
*   **Key Fields:**
    *   `id` (primary key, integer, NOT NULL, UNIQUE): A unique identifier for each room.
    *   `hotelId` (foreign key referencing the `id` field in the Hotels table, integer, NOT NULL): The identifier of the hotel that the room belongs to.
    *   `type` (varchar(255), NOT NULL): The type of room (e.g., single, double).
    *   `rate` (decimal(10, 2), NOT NULL): The rate of the room per night.
    *   `availability` (boolean, NOT NULL, DEFAULT TRUE): A flag indicating whether the room is available for booking.
*   **Relationships:** A room belongs to one hotel (many-to-one), so the `hotelId` field in the Rooms table references the `id` field in the Hotels table.

### Bookings Table

*   **Purpose:** The Bookings table stores information about the bookings made by customers.
*   **Key Fields:**
    *   `id` (primary key, integer, NOT NULL, UNIQUE): A unique identifier for each booking.
    *   `roomId` (foreign key referencing the `id` field in the Rooms table, integer, NOT NULL): The identifier of the room that was booked.
    *   `customerId` (integer, NOT NULL): The identifier of the customer who made the booking.
    *   `date` (date, NOT NULL): The date of the booking.
*   **Relationships:** A booking is associated with one room (many-to-one), so the `roomId` field in the Bookings table references the `id` field in the Rooms table.

### Indexes and Optimization

*   Create an index on the `hotelId` field in the Rooms table to improve query performance when retrieving rooms for a specific hotel.
*   Create an index on the `roomId` field in the Bookings table to improve query performance when retrieving bookings for a specific room.

### Seed Data

Here is some example seed data for testing purposes:

```sql
INSERT INTO Hotels (id, name, address) VALUES
(1, 'Hotel Sunshine', '123 Beach Blvd'),
(2, 'Hotel Oceanview', '456 Coastal Hwy');

INSERT INTO Rooms (id, hotelId, type, rate, availability) VALUES
(1, 1, 'single', 100.00, TRUE),
(2, 1, 'double', 150.00, TRUE),
(3, 2, 'single', 120.00, TRUE),
(4, 2, 'double', 180.00, TRUE);

INSERT INTO Bookings (id, roomId, customerId, date) VALUES
(1, 1, 1, '2022-01-01'),
(2, 2, 2, '2022-01-15');
```

### Complex Schema Enhancements

To add more sophisticated features like user authentication, room availability tracking, payment processing, or reviews, you can consider the following enhancements:

*   **User Authentication:** Add a Users table to store user information, including username, password, and role (e.g., customer, admin). Implement authentication logic to verify user credentials and authorize access to protected routes.
*   **Room Availability Tracking:** Add a RoomAvailability table to store the availability of each room for different dates. Implement logic to update the availability of rooms based on bookings and cancellations.
*   **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments for bookings. Add a Payments table to store payment information, including payment method, amount, and status.
*   **Reviews:** Add a Reviews table to store customer reviews for hotels and rooms. Implement logic to calculate the average rating for each hotel and room.

**Advanced Code Documentation and Refactoring**

### Code Comments

Here is an example of how you can add detailed comments to your code:

```javascript
// Create a server to handle HTTP requests
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Parse the URL to extract the pathname and query parameters
  const parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url, true);

  // Log the request method and URL for debugging purposes
  console.log(`Received request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);

  // Handle GET requests to retrieve available rooms
  if (parsedUrl.pathname === '/available-rooms' && req.method === 'GET') {
    // Filter the rooms to retrieve only available rooms
    const availableRooms = rooms.filter(room => room.availability);

    // Return the available rooms in JSON format
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify(availableRooms));
  }

  // Handle POST requests to book a room
  else if (parsedUrl.pathname === '/book-room' && req.method === 'POST') {
    // Extract the room ID and customer ID from the request body
    let body = '';
    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk;
    });
    req.on('end', () => {
      const { roomId, customerId } = JSON.parse(body);

      // Find the room with the specified ID
      const room = rooms.find(r => r.id === roomId);

      // Check if the room is available and book it if so
      if (room && room.availability) {
        room.availability = false;
        bookings.push({ roomId, customerId, date: new Date() });

        // Return a success message in JSON format
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
        res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Room booked successfully' }));
      } else {
        // Return an error message in JSON format if the room is not available
        res.writeHead(400, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
        res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Room not available' }));
      }
    });
  }

  // Handle other requests
  else {
    // Return a 404 error in JSON format
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Not Found' }));
  }
});
```

### Error Handling

To implement error handling, you can add try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors. For example:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error(error);
  res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
  res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Internal Server Error' }));
}
```

You can also use error-handling middleware to catch and handle errors in a centralized way.

### Code Refactoring

To refactor your code, you can consider the following suggestions:

*   **Modularize your code:** Break down your code into smaller, modular functions that each perform a specific task. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.
*   **Use asynchronous operations:** Use asynchronous operations to improve performance and avoid blocking the event loop.
*   **Reduce redundant code:** Remove redundant code and simplify your logic to make your code more efficient.

Here is an example of how you can refactor your code to make it more modular and efficient:

```javascript
// Create a function to retrieve available rooms
function getAvailableRooms() {
  return rooms.filter(room => room.availability);
}

// Create a function to book a room
function bookRoom(roomId, customerId) {
  const room = rooms.find(r => r.id === roomId);
  if (room && room.availability) {
    room.availability = false;
    bookings.push({ roomId, customerId, date: new Date() });
    return { message: 'Room booked successfully' };
  } else {
    return { message: 'Room not available' };
  }
}

// Create a server to handle HTTP requests
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Parse the URL to extract the pathname and query parameters
  const parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url, true);

  // Log the request method and URL for debugging purposes
  console.log(`Received request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);

  // Handle GET requests to retrieve available rooms
  if (parsedUrl.pathname === '/available-rooms' && req.method === 'GET') {
    const availableRooms = getAvailableRooms();
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify(availableRooms));
  }

  // Handle POST requests to book a room
  else if (parsedUrl.pathname === '/book-room' && req.method === 'POST') {
    let body = '';
    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk;
    });
    req.on('end', () => {
      const { roomId, customerId } = JSON.parse(body);
      const result = bookRoom(roomId, customerId);
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
      res.end(JSON.stringify(result));
    });
  }

  // Handle other requests
  else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Not Found' }));
  }
});
```
